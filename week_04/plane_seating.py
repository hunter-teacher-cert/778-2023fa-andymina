"""This program simulates the sales of tickets for a specific flight.

A plane is represented by a list. Each element of the list is a row in
the plane (with plane[0] being the front) and reach row is also a
list.

Seats can be purchased as economy_plus or regular economy.

Economy_plus passengers select their seats when they purchase their tickts.
Economy passengers are assigned randomly when the flight is closer to full

create_plane(rows,cols):
  Creates and returns a plane of size rowsxcols
  Plans have windows but no aisles (to keep the simulation simple)

get_number_economy_sold(economy_sold):
    Input: a dicitonary containing the number of regular economy seats sold. 
           the keys are the names for the tickets and the values are how many

    ex: {'Robinson':3, 'Lee':2 } // The Robinson family reserved 3
    seats, the Lee family 2

    Returns: the total number of seats sold

get_avail_seats(plane,economy_sold):
    Parameters: plane : a list of lists representing plaine
    economy_sold : a dictionary of the economy seats sold but
                   not necessarily assigned

    Returns: the number of unsold seats

    Notes: this loops over the plane and counts the number of seats
           that are "avail" or "win" and removes the number of
           economy_sold seats

get_total_seats(plane):
    Params: plane : a list of lists representing a plane
    Returns: The total number of seats in the plane

get_plane_string(plane):
    Params: plane : a list of lists representing a plane
    Returns: a string suitable for printing. 

purchase_economy_plus(plane,economy_sold,name):
    Params: plane - a list of lists representing a plane

            economy_sold - a dictionary representing the economy
                           sold but not assigned
            name - the name of the person purchasing the seat

    This routine randomly selects a seat for a person purchasing
    economy_plus. Preference is given to window and front seats.

seat_economy(plane,economy_sold,name):
    Similar to purchase_economy_plus but just randomy assigns
    a random seat.

purchase_economy_block(plane,economy_sold,number,name):
    Purchase regular economy seats. As long as there are sufficient seats
    available, store the name and number of seats purchased in the
    economy_sold dictionary and return the new dictionary


fill_plane(plane):
  takes an empty plane and runs our simulation to sell seats and then
  seat the economy passengers. See comments in the function for details.

  The main driver program - start here
