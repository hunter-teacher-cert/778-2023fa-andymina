# Privacy Policy

For this week's assignment, I chose to look at the privacy policies of Snapchat and Instagram, two
wildly popular social media platforms. My motivation for looking at these two was that most users
sign up for these platforms at a young age, often much younger than minimum age required, and don't
fully understand the implications of their digital footprint.

As one would expect, according to their privacy policies, both social media platforms collect data
and relevant information about content shared on their platform and content provided by the user.
However, I did find it interesting the Snapchat mentioned that the track/collect information from
cookies. This means Snapchat reads the shared storage in the browser, enabling them to track your
habits across different sites. While most may think they have nothing to worry about upon hearing
this, it's important to note that "cookies" has grown in recent times to also reflect shared
storage in non-browser environments. This means mobile users are also having their data tracked
across apps. I didn't see anything like this in Instagram's privacy policy, but I wouldn't be
surprised if it was true. At first glance, it's hard to tell _why_ Snapchat would want to track
user habits across sites other than their own, but in the technological age, user data is digital
gold.

One of the big differences between the privacy policies is that Snapchat grants users explicit
control over their information. While it's generally assumed that users have a right to their data,
many companies try to make the process of acquiring or the data collected extremely difficult,
effectively holding your digital footprint/privacy hostage.
