# Lockdown/spyware tools for remote test administration, Yes or No?

I hold that we should use lockdown and spyware tools for remote test administration for the
following reasons:

- assessments are foundational building blocks of learning and by extension, the future workforce.
if we don’t do all that we can to ensure the future workforce actually knows what they’re talking
about, we’re in very deep trouble. imagine if a doctor cheated their way through medical school and
was giving patients inadequate or inaccurate care.
- lockout tools promote a fair environment. without lockouts, some students are inclined to cheat
(there will always be bad actors). because students cheat without lockout tools, they over-inflate
the test statistics: curves become less reasonable, professors dont get a good sense of student
understanding, etc.
- lockout tools also allow for much greater review. some lockouts take video/audio and just as
student athletes watch back their games, watching back your test taking could inform you of areas
of improvement

there’s the concern that lockout systems violate privacy bc they record you in the home. however you determine the environment you take tests in. you can choose to take the test with lockdown tools in the college, against a neutral non-invasive background
