# Is using adblock unethical?

I argue that using adblock is unethical.

## Supporting Arguments

- social contract theory (john locke) - [ref](https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/social-contract-theory#:~:text=Social%20contract%20theory%20says%20that,a%20divine%20being%20requires%20it.)
  - the social contract theory is the theory that if some ruling class (in most cases the government) establishes a mutual control over a ruled class (in most cases citizens) then everyone must “play fair.” the government makes rules that the people should follow, and if the people don’t like rules they have a right to get a new government. this goes back to the ToS conversations we’ve had already.
- right to repair and modify ([introduction article](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/what-is-right-to-repair/), [mcdonalds right to repair](https://www.findlaw.com/legalblogs/federal-courts/mcdonalds-broken-ice-cream-machines-lead-to-right-to-repair-lawsuit/))
  - adblock is a website and even browser mod. there’s precedent for right to repair/mods being banned. with things like warranties being violated if you mess with products, tesla crackign down on customs features like peformance enahcning, and video game companies like nintendo not allowing mods.
- adblock pays the bills
  - if you want to use this service you must also pour into this service. if youtube generates ad money to support the product at the caliber you wish to use it, you must also be a patron of the company. there’s a symbiotic relationship to companies and customers where each needs the other.
  - this is the same reason why the MTA argues you shouldn’t jump the turnstile. they lose the necessary funds to maintain the mass transit system which is why you see them argue so hard for it.

- adblock enables pre emptive policing that scans content.
  - it works by scanning HTML structure for specific tags and syntax and reads
    the website content, violating your own privacy ([ref](https://helpcenter.getadblock.com/hc/en-us/articles/9738502775315-How-does-AdBlock-work-))
