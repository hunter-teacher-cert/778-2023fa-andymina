# Should companies break encryption for law enforcement?

I hold that companies should not have to break encryption for law enforcement.

## supporting arguments

- this shouldn't even be a problem.
  - with the onset of blockchain and uncrackable hash functions there shouldn't even be ways to
  reverse encryption. side point: this implies that companies are complicit is not guarding your
  privacy which goes to last week.
- you have a physical right to privacy and in the modern age, a digital right to privacy.
  - data on the internet isn't assumed to be public. there are places where your data is entirely
  private.
- data ownership, companies simply have no right to give out your data since it's your data.
they should remain neutral.
  - you have a right to refuse to unlock already. by extension, you don't have to surrender your
  digital data meaning you have ownership.

- hipaa has already set a bad precedent. bad actors will be given TOO much power
  - government can access your sensitive health info without a warrant. malicious actors can
  (and often) impersonate government officials to get your data. by restricting govts, we instantly
  rule out this method of social engineering for bad actors.

- san bernadino didn't go the legal route
  - Apple appealed saying the government was overreaching. the software to do this wasn't readily
  available and the feds wanted apple to create somthing to reverse-eng it. Apple took them to court,
  but later dropped the case as they found a third-party.
  - similar to garbage laws, if the feds want this data they should get it themselves.
- for sting operations and sweeps, when the feds come in they tell people to step away from open laptops.
  - open computers is in plainview and analogous to having an open bottle when driving. this gives
  the feds enough power to search and read through your data.
  
## counter arguments

- the safety of the public is important
  - we've traded the safety of the public in other circumstances.
  - this is a digital trolley problem. do we violate everyone's privacy and potential safety
  for some peoples' safety?
