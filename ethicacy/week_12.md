# Is it ethical for companies to reserve the right to repair/modify?

I argue that it is ethical.

## Supporting Arguments

- social contract theory (john locke) - [ref](https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/social-contract-theory#:~:text=Social%20contract%20theory%20says%20that,a%20divine%20being%20requires%20it.)
  - part of the social contract when you purchase a product is that in exchange for the company providing you with a product you must adhere to the rules and uses of said product.
- there's precedent for right to repair being owned by companies already

  - tesla crackes down on custom features
  - nintendo doesn't endorse mods

  - stickers that cover screw holes and say "warranty voided if removed"

  - if companies don't reserve the right to repair/mod and enforce it, independent parties can access
  trade or company secrets ([manufacturer complaints about r2r/m](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/nixing-fix-ftc-report-congress-repair-restrictions/nixing_the_fix_report_final_5521_630pm-508_002.pdf))
  - for some game console's right to repair can undermine anticheat hardware/firmware that is necessary
- the company's are actually doing their part to help you
  - there's a number of things that can go wrong when doing manual repairs. consider replacing a battery
  on an iphone: one poke with a screwdriver and the lithium ion better ignites
