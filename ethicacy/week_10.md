# is china’s surveillance state unethical?

- its purpose is public control and influence.
  - "nothing happened on 6/4/1989."
    - images of two athletes hugging banned for inadvertently referencing TS ([article](https://www.wionews.com/world/chinese-censors-rush-to-block-tiananmen-image-of-hugging-athletes-at-asian-games-642212)). china’s mass surveillance isn’t for the public good; it’s for control of the public. through a surveillance state, china can control what information is spread toward the general public.
    - this control of the masses even reaches toward other people. its has become increasingly common to send TS to chinese video game players and get them banned. ([steam](https://steamcommunity.com/app/840800/discussions/0/1848072002771422622/?l=schinese))
  - good things that happen are a by product of the surveillance state, not the intended purpose.
- the data collected isnt transparent
  - one could draw the analogy that our general technological use is also a form of hyper surveillance; think back to when we read the ToS and were all generally shocked. the difference is that you can request the data collected on you, whereas in the chinese surveillance state, this is a unidirectional relationship.
- people generally dont consent to this mass surveillance.
  - people have their biometric data taken ([article](https://www.npr.org/2022/09/07/1118105165/surveillance-state-explores-chinas-tech-and-social-media-control-systems), “other stories are far more troubling”) by force.
  - we talked last week about social contract theory. one could say that by living in china they consent to their mass surveillance of the state. however many chinese people speak out against this system. the problem is that they are silenced by the mass surveillance.

  - pre-covid hong kong rebellions crushed by a hyper militarized police force enabled by the ongoing mass surveillance ([article](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/03/technology/hong-kong-china-tech-surveillance.html))
- it doesnt serve the greater good
  - china’s idea of public control comes from Mao zedong: “only strong authority can bring order to a turbulent country”. people are willing to have their rights violated for the greater good, but the problem with the mass chinese surveillance is that it’s not promoting a greater good anymore. china’s economy is down and theres a severe wealth gap. ([article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/business/china-surveillance-technology.html))
  - violating rights for the greater good isn’t uncommon. consider habeas corpus in the status during the civil war. the difference is that this was later restored in 1866. chinese citizens live in this permanent state without any sign of release from the surveillance state. its the same reasons why political scientists condemn the war on terror or the war on drugs bc they have no end unlike a national or state emergency
