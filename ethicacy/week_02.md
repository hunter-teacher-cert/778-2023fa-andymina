# Is safeguarding privacy the responsibility of the consumer or company?

I hold thath the company has an ethical responsibility to safeguard consumer privacy.

## supporting arguments

- consumers can’t reasonably “buyer beware”
  - it’s hard to know if company is reckless with the data you provide. ideally in a supermarket, you can choose not to buy rotting fruits but in the tech market you can’t easily pick out which tech companies are rotten. consumers are forced to rely on good faith. a good example of this is t-mobile's austrian division storing passwords in plaintext ([article](https://www.pcmag.com/news/t-mobile-austria-is-ok-with-storing-passwords-partly-in-clear-text)).

- damage could be huge and wide-spread
  - many people don’t practice good tech security (2fa, avoiding re-using passwords, changing passwords frequently) and as odd as it sounds, at the end of the day its the consumer right to do so.  going back to the market, sometimes i want to buy overripe bananas because they still serve a purpose, most notably to banana bread. older people use the internet and some aren’t as tech-savvy as the general populous assumes them to be. if companies don’t safeguard consumer privacy, those who don’t have good tech health are in deep trouble. passwords that are reused for bank accounts and other sensitive info could destroy someones life if a malicious hacker got ahold of them. with enough people, this could cause a collapse in integral functions within society. an example of this would be [2017 equifax hack](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/14/equifax-used-admin-for-the-login-and-password-of-a-non-us-database.html) where the internal login credentials were admin, admin.
  - average “joes” aren’t the consumers of big tech products. a lot of our tech advances begin in military R and D. while i’m sure the military enacts privacy standards of their own, the companies of the products they use are still vulnerable to being exploited/hacked. this could severely weaken our global standing. [GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System) is a good example of a technology that started in military R&D.
- companies have a financial incentive
  - with respect to the “free market,” companies that sell better products, in this case, safer products, will attract more customers and make more profits, ultimately outliving their lesser-suited competitors. this is one of the main reasons that whatsapp pushes their own e2e encryption so heavily and why it’s regarded as the safest messaging platform (despite being owned by Meta). here's a [whatsapp ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gt8izblYcM) that sells the products security.
- we already hold other institutions and professional domains to this standard
  - safeguarding end user’s privacy isn’t new at all. regulations like HIPPA and FERPA are long standing defend patients’ and students’ privacy respectively. HIPPA protects PHI so patients trust medical professionals with their health more. FERPA exist so that students aren’t wrongfully targeted by third parties (anyone outside of their direct education chain of command).
