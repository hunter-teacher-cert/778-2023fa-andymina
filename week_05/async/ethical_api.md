# Ethical APIs

The API based programs we wrote in class (payroll/liquor APIs) could definitely be used in unethical
manners. Since this data is publicly available, everyone's first thought is to catastrophize and
imagine ways that bad actors could use this data with malicious intent. Both of these programs can
be extended to spur and ethical debate in numerous ways, but I am more personally interested in ways
the payroll program we wrote could be extended than the liquoe program. For unethical engineers,
it is possible that someone could target public officials given their salaries. While these salaries
are not exorbitant amounts, they definitely raise cause for concern. Within the context of education,
parents or others who are invested within the public education institution could use the public
salaries as leverage to get teachers to act to their will. It is not unreasonable for some parents
to refuse to send their kids to school with basic supplies (i.e. pens or pencils) if they know the
teacher gets paid enough to provide these supplies out of pocket. Another reason is that when the
school wishes to take students on educational field trips of the sort, parents may opt or even go
as far to request refunds as they are technically paying a teacher for time that is not spent
teaching.

However, this program also has ethical purposes. If findings extracted from this data were posted
in a public setting within the school, it can lead to lower-paid teachers demanding higher pay to
meet that of their higher-paid counterparts. This gives the teachers more leverage into earning a
fair wage for the work that they do because we all know that teachers work close to 80-hour weeks
with lesson planning, curriculum development, and other administrative responsibilites.
